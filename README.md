# AyushPI-API

A REST API that fetches information from a huge database of Ayurvedic medicines. The database contains over 600 medicines (699 to be precise), with all the information from its uses to the precautions, if any. The API displays the info through a symptom search, which can be filtered while displaying using any application.

Several unit test cases have been added to the project to facilitate ease.
